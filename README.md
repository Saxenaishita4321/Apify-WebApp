# Apify Runner - Generic HTTP Request Actor

A modern web application that allows users to execute generic HTTP requests through a clean, intuitive interface. Built with React frontend and Node.js backend, this application provides a powerful tool for testing APIs and making HTTP requests with full method support (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS).

## üöÄ How to Install and Run Your Application

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- An Apify API key (get one from [Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/account#/integrations))

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup
1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application will open automatically at `http://localhost:3000`

### Access the Application
1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. You'll see the "Connect to Apify" screen
3. Enter your Apify API key and click "Connect"

## üéØ Which Actor You Chose for Testing

For this project, I implemented a **Generic HTTP Request Actor** that allows users to make any type of HTTP request without needing to create a specific Apify actor. This approach provides maximum flexibility and demonstrates the core functionality.

### Actor Features:
- **Full HTTP Method Support**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS
- **Dynamic Input Schema**: Automatically adapts based on the selected HTTP method
- **Real-time Execution**: Immediate feedback with detailed response information
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and validation

### Testing Endpoints Used:
- **JSONPlaceholder API**: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts` for testing various HTTP methods
- **HTTPBin**: `https://httpbin.org/post` for general HTTP testing

## üé® Any Assumptions or Notable Design Choices You Made

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Backend Proxy Pattern**: The backend acts as a proxy to Apify's API, keeping the API key secure and not exposed to the frontend
2. **Generic HTTP Request Implementation**: Instead of using a specific Apify actor, I created a generic HTTP request handler that can make any type of HTTP request
3. **Real-time Execution**: The application makes HTTP requests directly rather than using Apify's actor system for immediate results

### UI/UX Design Choices
1. **Modern Card-based Layout**: Clean, modern interface with cards and proper spacing
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information is shown step-by-step to avoid overwhelming users
3. **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, success indicators, and error messages with appropriate icons
4. **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices

### Technical Implementation Choices
1. **React Hooks**: Used functional components with hooks for state management
2. **Express.js Backend**: Simple, lightweight server for API proxy functionality
3. **Axios for HTTP Requests**: Reliable HTTP client for making requests
4. **CORS Support**: Enabled cross-origin requests for development
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling at both frontend and backend levels

### Security Considerations
1. **API Key Protection**: API keys are never exposed to the frontend
2. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing
3. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Production-ready with HTTPS support

## üì∏ Screenshots Demonstrating the Working Flow

### 1. Initial Connection Screen
